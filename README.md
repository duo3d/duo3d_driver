#DUO3D Driver for ROS 

The `duo3d_driver` ROS node interfaces with DUO SDK and publishes stereo images, disparity, point cloud, and IMU data from the DUO3D sensor. This package is build on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS running ROS Kinetic.

##Introduction
The DUO MLX is an ultra-compact imaging sensor with global shutter and a standard USB interface for ease of use and connectivity. The DUO is intended for use in research, autonomous navigation, robotics and industrial areas. The camera's high speed and small size make it ideal for existing and new use cases for vision based applications.

With a programmable illumination board and built-in IR filters and auto-exposure it allows for precise control of lighting environment, delivering configurable and precise stereo imaging for robotics, inspection, microscopy, visual odometry, human computer interaction and beyond.

The DUO MLX solution consists of:

 * Factory Calibrated Stereo Camera
 * Industrial Grade Monochrome/Global Shutter Sensors
 * Integrated Accelerometer/Gyroscope/Temperature (6 DoF IMU)
 * Fully Programmable Active LED Array (3xIR 850nm High Power LEDs)
 * DUO SDK License
 * DUO Dense3D License
 * USB Mini-B Cable

The DUO line of sensors offer a versatile board level solution for 3D sensing, a solution equipped with IMU and IR illumination and a board level sensor with an aluminum enclosure and a complete system for utilizing stereo vision that comes with a DUO MLX sensor and the DUO VPC processor. All DUO sensors are ready to work right out of the box and support a wide range of accessories and configurations.

##Installation

###DUO SDK
The DUO SDK package is required for DUO device support under your Linux operating system. It consists of kernel module and user mode libraries that expose all of the DUO functionalities with a simple and concise C/C++ API. Included in the package is the Dense3D&trade;, an SIMD/NEON optimized multi-threaded library that performs the disparity and 3D data extraction from DUO stereo image pair. 

 * To download the DUO SDK visit the [Download page](https://duo3d.com/docs/downloads)
 * To install the DUO SDK follow the [Install guide](https://duo3d.com/docs/articles/install-all)

###DUO ROS package
DUO ROS driver is developed and supported in ROS Kinetic. 

Get the package from github and put it in your catkin workspace ''src'' folder:

    $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/duo3d/duo3d_driver
    $ chmod a+x cfg/Duo3D.cfg

Build the package:

    $ cd ~/catkin_ws
    $ catkin_make duo3d_driver
    $ source ./devel/setup.bash
